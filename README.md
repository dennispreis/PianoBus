# PianoBus

The PianoBus is a creative project that bridges music and electronics by using a piano to control a physical motor. It demonstrates how MIDI signals generated by a musical instrument can be captured, interpreted, and used to drive hardware via a microcontroller.

When a piano key is pressed, a MIDI message is sent to a computer and processed by a Java application written in Processing. Using the The MidiBus library, the MIDI message is detected and translated into a serial command. This command is then sent to an Arduino Nano, which interprets it to control the motor: making it rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, or stop, depending on the key pressed.

The data flow is simple but powerful:

Piano → MIDI data → Processing → Serial → Arduino Nano → Motor

## Applications
PianoBus serves as a fun and educational demonstration of how musical input can interact with mechanical systems. It is ideal for learning about MIDI communication, serial protocols, and microcontroller programming, and it opens the door to creative installations, kinetic sculptures, or music-driven machines.
